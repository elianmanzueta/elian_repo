I'm working on creating a network configuration tool written in Python with the modules Tkinter and Netmiko.  As of right now, I've implemented VLAN creation and port mode selection, in the future I aim to add more capabilities to the script like interface configuration and more.

The GUI will tell you what you've inputted for your selections, and then output the Cisco IOS CLI configuration.
