I'm working on creating a network configuration tool written in Python with the modules Tkinter and Netmiko.  As of right now, I've implemented basic L2 switch configuration and will be working on allowing the user to switch between L2/L3 switch configuration in the future.

The GUI will tell you what you've inputted for your selections, and then output the Cisco IOS CLI configuration plus a verification by showing the interface show run.
